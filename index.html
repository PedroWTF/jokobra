<h1>this page is useless. just like me. and maybe you.</h1>
<h2>(written by a fading shadow on someone else’s window)</h2>

<p>
  i didn’t build this to be understood.<br>
  i built this because everything else felt like a fucking lie.<br>
  they told me to be productive.<br>
  they told me to manifest.<br>
  they told me to smile through it.<br>
  but no one asked if i even wanted to be here.
</p>

<p>
  i opened vscode at 2AM.<br>
  <em>let down</em> was playing on repeat.<br>
  my speaker’s broken, but somehow still louder than my thoughts.<br>
  this isn’t art. or healing.<br>
  just what happens when silence turns into a scream.
</p>

<p>
  i tried design. crypto. editing. painting faces. building shit.<br>
  nothing worked.<br>
  every time i get close, life throws a “try again, bitch.”
</p>

<h3>some nights hit like this:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>scroll past lives you can’t afford</li>
  <li>laugh at pain that sounds too familiar</li>
  <li>feel guilty for resting</li>
  <li>post something real, then delete it</li>
  <li>exist. barely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>how i survived? i didn’t. i just stayed conscious.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>started shit i never finished</li>
  <li>made memes out of breakdowns</li>
  <li>said "i'm okay" too many times</li>
  <li>watched pets die. forgot to feel</li>
  <li>wrote this. just to feel something real</li>
</ul>

<p>
  if you’re still here — maybe you’re bleeding too.<br>
  maybe you’re just tired of pretending.<br>
  whatever the reason: thanks.<br>
  in a world this fake, presence is a miracle.
</p>

<h3>about me:</h3>
<p>
  i’m pedro. or something like that.<br>
  not a guru. not a brand. not okay. just trying.<br>
  this page is proof i existed, even if for one weird night at 2AM.
</p>

<p>
  why HTML?<br>
  because i was too lazy to make it complicated.<br>
  turns out, even <em>this</em> dumb shit can be read like it matters.
</p>

<h3>you read this far?</h3>
<p>
  wild.<br>
  or maybe you just needed it more than you thought.<br>
  either way — you’re here.<br>
  and that’s punk as hell.
</p>
